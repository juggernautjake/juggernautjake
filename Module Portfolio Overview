	Personal Discription:
	    This project will allow me to develop a personal portfolio containing all of the 
	    projects I have been working on over the past few months in this course. I can also 
	    upload any other projects that I have been working on in my own time. This will be a 
	    useful resource for keeping a collection of my projects in one place and displaying 
	    them neatly, as well as for impressing potential employers.
